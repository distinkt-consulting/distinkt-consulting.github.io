<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap"> A</span>t the 53rd Congress of the German Society for Psychology (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychologie,  DGPs) and the 15th Congress of the Österreichische Gesellschaft für Psychologie (ÖGP) in  Vienna, Gerhard Benetka, Alexander Nicolai Wendt, and I had the pleasure of conducting the inaugural workshop on presuppositional analysis. This one-day Pre-Conference Workshop at  DGPs2024 provided 15 early-stage researchers with an introduction to a unique philosophical method designed to shed light on the often-overlooked tacit assumptions in psychological research.

 Presuppositions are implicit assumptions that underly nearly all psychological research. They frame our definitions, theories, methods, operationalizations, research designs, and interpretations of empirical data. Despite their fundamental role, these assumptions remain frequently unexamined. Identifying and scrutinizing them requires specialized knowledge and training, which is why we developed a presuppositional analysis method and a workshop-format both tailored for psychological  metaresearch.

We were delighted to see how adeptly the workshop participants adopted the concept of presuppositional analysis and how skillful they applied it to their own research - shifting it at some point to another theoretical level.

The feedback and insights gained from the participants have deepened our understanding of how and where this meta-method can be effectively applied and where it might still present some challenges. 

We are looking forward to refine this  metamethod and to make a meaningful contribution to research in  psychology by widening the repertoire of  theoreticalPsychology.

Our thanks go to the DGPS and ÖGP, and especially to the congress organizing team, who have managed the consequences of difficult weather conditions in Vienna with remarkable professionalism and effort.

On a personal note, I am grateful to the Chair of Work and Organizational Psychology at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg and the DAAD Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst for their support.
